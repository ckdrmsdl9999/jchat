# jchat
===========

A light-weight client-server chatting program built on top of ocsf framework 

##OCSF: The Object Client/Server Framework 
OCSF is a Java framework that can be used to develop client-server systems.

This framework is called OCSF to reflect the fact that the client-server
systems built using this framework will exchange Java objects. It is therefore
strongly object-oriented as all the lower-level communication layers are
encapslated inside the framework.

This framework is described in the book "Object-Oriented Software Engineering:
Practical Software Development using UML and Java" By Timothy C.  Lethbridge
and Robert Lagani√®re.
